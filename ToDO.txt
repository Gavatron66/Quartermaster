Models to add checks for Numeric Up Down controls:
	Death Guard Cultists
	Necron Warriors
	Hybrid Metamorphs

Genestealer Cults has weird custom factions
	Add either more boxes or do a Checkbox system
	
Fix Load/Save buttons
	With all the changes (i.e. the existence of the Roster class), the Load/Save functions need to be visited to work properly.
		Hopefully not too hard :) (fingers crossed)
		
Provide an error if a datasheet has not selected enough Psychic Powers
