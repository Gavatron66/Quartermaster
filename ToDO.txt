Points
	Have the points function run when the unit gets initialized?

Validate Roster
	Provide an error when the roster is invalid
	Check the following:
		Under points limit
		Valid detachment slots filled
		Death Guard specific:
			Three FOETID VIRON units can take up one Elite slot
			Only one LORD OF THE DEATH GUARD per detachment
	Do this in the overhead class
		Error shows in the main form, but the overhead dictates when the error shows up
		Except points. They can be tracked in the main form

Units that have been skipped: (Once I figure out the templates thing than these can be done, since they might need new templates)
	Acolyte Hybrids
	Neophyte Hybrids
	Hybrid Metamorphs
	Aberrants (Not too different from code "N1kS(1m)")
	Biophagus (1k_c, very simple implementation)
	Atalan Jackals

GSC Units that need the Faction Upgrade stuff:
	Purestrain Genestealers
	
Abominant needs to be reviewed, it's got weird stuff going on

Found an issue with Custodes: if a Knight-Centura is included, it messes up the available Warlord Trait options
