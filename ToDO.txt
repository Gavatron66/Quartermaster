Need to Fix the custom faction stuff, it doesn't seem to working

Fix Named Characters? Some named Characters belong to specific subfactions, and technically if they contain a different subfaction keyword than they invalidate the detachment.

	They have annoyingly complicated options, so going to need some testing for it
Some Aeldari Vehicles show points cost in the select list.

Tyranids need a look at custom Hive Fleets
