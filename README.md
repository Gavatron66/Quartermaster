This is a tabletop game roster builder program. I plan to make this as universally applicable as possible, however, at the moment I'm coding it for Warhammer 40k.
The following factions have been implemented: Death Guard, Necrons, Adeptus Custodes, Genestealer Cults, Space Marines, Aeldari (Craftworlds and Harlequins), Tyranids and Adeptus Mechanicus.
