# Quartermaster
This is a tabletop game roster builder program. I plan to make this as universally applicable as possible, however, at the moment I'm coding it for Warhammer 40k.
The following factions have been implemented: Death Guard, Necrons, Adeptus Custodes, Genestealer Cults, Space Marines (all subfactions except Black Templars and Blood Angels), Aeldari (Craftworlds and Harlequins), Tyranids, Adeptus Mechanicus, T'au Empire, Orks, Grey Knights, Drukhari, and Adepta Sororitas.

# Downloads
To download, go to bin/debug and download Roster Builder.exe. Note that this is an incomplete product and I will be actively working on this for the foreseeable future.
